# 🔍 Deep Dive into Apache Spark Source Code

Welcome to my personal deep-dive into the [Apache Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark) source code. This project is a curated, structured study of Spark’s internals — designed to help others understand its architecture, key components, and internal execution flow.

Each module is explored with detailed Markdown notes, code tracing, diagrams, and summaries.

## 📌 Goals

- Understand how Apache Spark works under the hood
- Summarize key components like RDD, DAG scheduler, Catalyst optimizer
- Provide annotated diagrams and call flows
- Make it easier for new contributors to onboard into Spark

## 🧭 How to Use This Repository

If you're a:
- **Beginner** → Start with `examples/sparkpi-explained.md`
- **Intermediate** → Move to `core/RDD.md` and `core/SparkContext.md`
- **Advanced** → Explore `sql/`, Catalyst, and internal optimizations
